\usage{
communityMapping.DynComm(dyncomm,differential, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{dyncomm}{A DynComm object, if not using the inline version of the 
function call}

\item{differential}{If TRUE, only values that have changed in the latest run 
will be returned}

\item{file}{If given, outputs the community mapping to the given file instead 
of the console}
}
\value{
a matrix with either the community mapping or a boolean value
}
\description{
Get the community mapping for all communities from the selected post processing
algorithm or the main algorithm, after the last iteration.
}
\details{
If file is not given, returns a two column matrix with vertices in 
the first column and the communities in the second.

If file is given, returns a single row, single column matrix with TRUE or 
FALSE, depending whether if writing to file succeeded or failed, respectively.

When writing to file, if the Community-Vertex program parameter is TRUE, each 
line of the file will have the community first, followed by a list of vertices
that belong to the community. If that parameter is FALSE, each line will have
a single vertex followed by its community. All values are separated by a white
character.
